      <tal:tag>Tags with namespaces will apparently be filtered out
               by HTML Tidy, but their contents will remain.  I'm not sure how I feel about that
               but then again it's not something that really ought to come up.  Now that we've 
               switched to nekohtml, however, it is no longer an issue.
